<p>Third Sunday - Year B</p>
<p>Jonah 3:1-5, 10; 1 Corinthians 7:29-31; Mark 1:14-20</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All three readings in today&rsquo;s liturgy refer to time. Nineveh has only forty left, for the Corinthians time is running out, and Jesus brings the fulfillment of time. This message about the shortness of time contains an urgent call for decision: &ldquo;Repent and believe in the Gospel&rdquo; (Mark 1:15).</p>
<p>The New Testament uses two words to describe time: chronos and kairos. The first one refers to time we see on our watches, the second to a time of opportunity. When Herod asked the Wise Men from the East “what time the star appeared”, the Gospel used the word &ldquo;chronos&rdquo; (Mt 2: 7). In today&rsquo;s readings, however, the evangelist Mark and the apostle Paul use the word &ldquo;kairos&rdquo;. Forty days offered to Nineveh and the appearance of Jesus by the sea of Galilee are both kairos - an opportune time given for repentance and returning to God. With each passing day, however, this kairos is being shortened (1 Corinthians 7:29).</p>
<p>Instead of waiting forty days and see what would had happened, the citizens of Nineveh immediately proclaimed a fast and turned from their evil way (Jonah 3:10). Repentance averted destruction. Forty days passed away and the city was still standing, because “the people of Nineveh believed God” (Jonah 3:5). An immediate reaction also takes place in the Gospel. Hearing Jesus’ call, “come after me”, four Galilean fishermen without hesitation entrusted themselves to Him. They left behind what they knew well and started their journey into the unknown. Faith in Jesus became the foundation on which they built their new life, and thus they have gone down in history as &ldquo;fishers of people&rdquo; and &ldquo;pillars of the Church of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“The fashion of this world is passing away &ldquo;(1 Corinthians 7:31). Our citizenship is in heaven and human life is only a short pilgrimage through the earth. In view of this truth, earthly realities such as marital life, trade and the use of the worldly goods do not possess absolute value. The sufferings and joys of this life are also transient. Temporal suffering cannot be compared with the future glory (Rom. 8:18), and worldly joys pale in comparison with the joy of reaching heaven (Rev. 21: 1-7). Thus, as pilgrims in this world our most important task is to proclaim the Gospel of Christ in words and deeds and look forward to those heavenly realities promised to us by Christ.</p>
<p>Minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years pass away, and before we even realize old age knocks at our door. Yet, this usual chronology of life is today shattered by the liturgy of the Word. Behold, God comes into our lives. Jonah presents us with a choice between salvation and destruction. Saint Paul challenges us to look beyond worldliness towards eternity. Finally, Saint Mark demands from us an immediate decision to follow Christ. Time is running out! The advent of God’s kingdom demands from us an instant and wise decision.</p>
